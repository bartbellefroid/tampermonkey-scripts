## Bol.com - Alternative Search Suggestions with GPT-4

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.3-blue)

### About this script
This script adds AI-generated alternative search suggestions when searching on Bol.com. When you search for products on Bol.com, the script will suggest an alternative search term that you could use to find similar or relevant products.

The suggestions are generated by OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model, which is a large language model capable of creating creative and relevant alternatives.

#### Step 3: Get an OpenAI API Key

3. Go to the [API Keys section](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
4. Click "Create new secret key"
5. Give your key a name (e.g., "Bol.com Search Suggestions")
6. Copy the API key and save it in a secure location (it will only be shown once)
7. Make sure your OpenAI account has a payment method set up, as the API is not free

#### Step 4: First Use and Configuration
1. Go to [Bol.com](https://www.bol.com)
2. Search for any product
3. On the search results page, the script will prompt you for your OpenAI API key

### Troubleshooting
- **Script not working**: Make sure Tampermonkey is enabled and the script is turned on in the Tampermonkey dashboard
- **API key errors**: Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and your account has a payment method set up
- **No suggestions appearing**: Check that you're on a Bol.com search results page (URL should contain "/s/")
- **Need to update API key**: Click on the Tampermonkey icon, select "Dashboard", find the script, and click "Edit". Look for the getApiKey function and remove the line with GM_getValue('openai_api_key')
