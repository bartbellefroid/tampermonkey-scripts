### About this script
This script adds AI-generated alternative search suggestions when searching on Bol.com. When you search for products on Bol.com, the script will suggest an alternative search term that you could use to find similar or relevant products.

The suggestions are generated by OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model, which is a large language model capable of creating creative and relevant alternatives.
